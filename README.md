# Git Server

## Quickstart

NOTE: This installs a bunch of dependencies and does automatic things to your system. It's only meant to be run on a freshly installed Linux distro which will be dedicated to being a git remote server.

```shell
curl -sL https://tinyurl.com/git-server-init | bash
```

### Optional Suggestion

Install GitCid into any existing git repo:

```shell
source <(curl -sL https://tinyurl.com/gitcid) -e
```
